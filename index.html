                    I've completed all of my study at the University of Auckland, originally studying biological sciences with a marine science specialisation, I was swiftly coerced to switch to a double major in biology and statistics. While I enjoyed most of my biology papers, I found I enjoyed statistics more (it is more enjoyable, and they introduced me to this thing called R).
                    Therefore, I didn't hesitate to enrol in postgraduate study in statistics.

                            Improving real-time prediction of bus arrival
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            <strong>The main goal of my current work is to model Auckland's entire public transport system in real time, in order to make reliable preditions about arrival time.</strong>
                            The first piece of the puzzle involves a <strong>particle filter</strong> model to determine the <strong>speed</strong> (and other variables) based on the observed GPS position of all buses in the Auckland public transport network. The second piece is a <strong>Kalman filter</strong> that uses bus speeds from the particle filter to estimate the speed along <em>individual segments of road</em>.
                            Finally, the estimated speeds will be used to predict how long it will take for each bus to travel from its current position to future stops.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>What is a particle filter?</strong>
                            Basically, parallel universes.
                            But instead of universes, we have buses! A whole fleet of imaginary&mdash;but plausible&mdash;buses, all traveling along the route at different speeds, some stopping at bus stops and traffic lights while others don't.
                            Then, whenever we receive a GPS position update from the <strong>real bus</strong>, we delete any imaginary buses that are no longer plausible (i.e., near the observed location).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <strong>And how about that Kalman filter you mentioned?</strong>
                          This is just a way of <strong>updating</strong> a previous estimate when we receive a new observation, allowing the <strong>state</strong> (speed along a section of road) to change over time, but also allowing for uncertainty in the measurements (bus speeds).
                          The more buses that recently traveled down a piece of road, the better our estimate of the average speed&mdash;and how variable it is: did the buses travel at similar speeds, or were they quite different?

                                    The size-selectivity of fishing gear is of particular interest to fisheries managers, aiding in the reduction of by-catch and increase of profits. Size-selectivity models have typically been fitted using <abbr title="Generalised Linear Models" class="initialism">GLMs</abbr> and mixed-effects models implemented using software such as SAS. We investigate a Bayesian approach to fitting these models, with special focus on the comparability of frequentist and Bayesian models. We look at several case studies, which are used to establish the validity of our models by comparing our results to those published in previous analyses. <abbr title="Mackov chain Monte Carlo">MCMC</abbr> diagnostic tests and <abbr title="Posterior Predictive Checks">PPCs</abbr> for overdispersion are explored, and random-effects are shown to be the preferred method of modelling overdispersion in the data. Having formulated a general model, several extensions are investigated. The Poisson distribution is used as an alternative likelihood function, allowing the models to make use of any population size distribution information, and multiple random-effects models are implemented that were previously found to be too complex. Semiparametric selection curves&mdash;notably basis splines&mdash;are used with the constraint that they be continuous, non-decreasing functions of length. <a href="http://tomelliott.co.nz/bsm">A new R package, <code>BSM</code></a>, is introduced as a simple tool for fitting many of the Bayesian selectivity models discussed in this thesis.

                                    Reverberation mapping is a technique used to infer the lag, <span class='math'>&tau;</span>, between two light curves obtained from two different regions of <abbr title="Active Galactic Nuclei" class="initialism">AGN</abbr>. The lag can later be used in the estimation of the mass of the central black hole. Traditional reverberation mapping methods involve the use of the <abbr title="Cross Correlation Function" class="initialism">CCF</abbr>, and more recently Bayesian models to estimate the lag, however these require long, expensive observational campaigns to obtain the data necessary to infer the lag accurately. The difficulty in obtaining the data has led to the development of a new technique where the <abbr title="Cross Correlation Function" class="initialism">CCF</abbr>s from multiple poorly-measured <abbr title="Active Galactic Nuclei" class="initialism">AGN</abbr> are combined, or stacked, to infer a typical lag for the sample. Through simulation, this method was shown to recover the lag, although the population lag variability and uncertainty of the lag estimate due to the sparse data were difficult to differentiate from the stacked <abbr title="Cross Correlation Function" class="initialism">CCF</abbr>. Therefore, we proposed using a Bayesian hierarchical model as an alternative, with the advantage of obtaining individual estimates for population variability and estimation error. After first implementing a simple model to show our method could be used to recover the population mean lag, we constructed a model that would analyse multiple <abbr title="Active Galactic Nuclei" class="initialism">AGN</abbr> and infer the population distribution of lags.  We were able to recover the population parameters, and their associated uncertainties, and show that the population variability was separable from the uncertainty in estimating the mean lag.

                            iNZight is developed by students here at the University of Auckland,

                            and more recently the main GUI.
