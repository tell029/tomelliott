    <h2>a data nerd</h2>

    <p>
        With an undergraduate degree in biological sciences, perhaps it's necessary to explain how I ended up where I am. I've always had an (unhealthy?) interest in computers, but had always treated it as a hobby, not a career path.
        However, while doing my Bachelor of Science I somehow ended up taking a stage II
        statistics paper which involved learning R. A love affair blossomed. I realised I could do something I enjoyed <emph>as a career</emph>, so here I am, studying statistics and developing statistical software.

        From black holes to fishing nets to buses, I've done a few (what I believe to be) interesting research projects, so here's a little information about each of them (in reverse order).
