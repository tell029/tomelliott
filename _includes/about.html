He is usually involved in Bayesian modelling and statistical computing, which extends to his role as core designer and developer of the data analysis and visualisation software iNZight. When not at University, Tom likes to read, play computer games, and listen to music.<div class="button read-more">read more ...</div></div></div></div><div class="row secondary"><div class="col-2"><p>Tom started out at the University of Auckland in 2010, under the pretense of becoming a Marine Biologist. That latest almost one year, at which point he discovered his true passion: statistics. And so, his undergraduate degree became a mix-and-match of biological, mathematical and statistical papers to ensure he would qualify for a postgraduate degree in Statistics.</p><p>Having completed two research projects, Tom has decided he would like to pursue a career in statistical research, starting off with the PhD he is currently undertaking. His main interests are in Bayesian modeling, graphics, and computing. Tom also dabbles in a small amount of web development (as witnessed here), ranging from front-end HTML, (S)CSS, and Javascript, to back-end PHP and MySQL. Most importantly, he is a Linux buff and the only time he uses Windows is to play games (including a range of titles such as Civilization, Assassins Creed, Battlefield, and Star Wars Battlefront when it is finally released).</p><p>Outside of computers and statistics, Tom occasionally considers himself a musician, and has been playing piano for a fairly sufficient amount of time. He also enjoys reading, most of which is ficional fantasy, although he may branch out from time to time. If you want to talk to Tom about any of the above, perhaps you could tweet him @tomelliott90.</p></div></div><div class="prev-arrow hidden"></div><div class="next-arrow"></div></section>
