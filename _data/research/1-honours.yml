text: Reverberation mapping is a technique used to infer the lag, <span class='math'>&tau;</span>, between two light curves obtained from two different regions of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Active Galactic Nuclei">AGN</span>. The lag can later be used in the estimation of the mass of the central black hole. Traditional reverberation mapping methods involve the use of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Cross Correlation Function">CCF</span>, and more recently Bayesian models to estimate the lag, however these require long, expensive observational campaigns to obtain the data necessary to infer the lag accurately. The difficulty in obtaining the data has led to the development of a new technique where the CCFs from multiple poorly-measured AGN are combined, or stacked, to infer a typical lag for the sample. Through simulation, this method was shown to recover the lag, although the population lag variability and uncertainty of the lag estimate due to the sparse data were difficult to differentiate from the stacked CCF. Therefore, we proposed using a Bayesian hierarchical model as an alternative, with the advantage of obtaining individual estimates for population variability and estimation error. After first implementing a simple model to show our method could be used to recover the population mean lag, we constructed a model that would analyse multiple AGN and infer the population distribution of lags.  We were able to recover the population parameters, and their associated uncertainties, and show that the population variability was separable from the uncertainty in estimating the mean lag.
