  info:
    - iNZight is a free, easy-to-use data exploration and analysis tool aimed at users with little experience with statistics. I have been involved since the middle of 2013, and since then have become heavily involved in the advancement of the software.
    - My main contribution so far is the (re)development of the graphics module, aptly named <code>iNZightPlots</code>. Our aims were fairly specific, and we wanted to have as much flexibility as possible in the long-run, so I decided to use <code>grid</code> to develop the package, as it allows very flexible layouts. Additionally, the package needed to be able to handle survey (and frequency) data <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="&hellip; at the time of writing, which was September 2015.">(which it does, mostly, but still needs work)</span>.
    - As well as the graphics, I have built upon and expanded the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="graphical user interface">GUI</span> to make it responsive, cleaner, and hopefuly user-friendly. I touched up the <code>iNZightRegression</code> package to provide nicer ([survey] generalised) linear model summaries, as well as set up the R package repository for all of our packages to allow cleaner updating for users.

  info:
    - As part of my MSc Thesis work, I developed an R package to provide a simple method of fitting some fairly complicated Bayesian selectivity models. The package started off in a simple attempt to make my life easier, but in doing so I realised it might be useful to others. Where possible, I have used familiar syntax as to make it easy to use for non-specialists.
    - The package allows the fitting of simple through to fairly complex Bayesian selectivity models, including a simple, single variable logistic fit, automatic inclusion of sampling fractions, through to hierarchical multi-covariate models. Plot and summary methods have been included, which allow the resulting fit to easily be examined both visually and textually. The plots include fitted curves through the data, and posterior trace and density plots; the summaries provide estimates, variability, a formula for the model, fit assessment statistics, and Bayesian PPCs.
    - I have not yet submitted the package to CRAN, as I don't feel it is ready yet, but thanks to others' wonderful work, you can install directly from GitHub using <code>devtools</code>. More details can be found <a href="assets/docs/tomelliott-masters.pdf">in my thesis</a>.
