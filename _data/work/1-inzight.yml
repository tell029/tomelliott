info:
  - iNZight is a free, easy-to-use data exploration and analysis tool aimed at users with little experience with statistics. I have been involved since the middle of 2013, and since then have become heavily involved in the advancement of the software.
  - My main contribution so far is the (re)development of the graphics module, aptly named <code>iNZightPlots</code>. Our aims were fairly specific, and we wanted to have as much flexibility as possible in the long-run, so I decided to use <code>grid</code> to develop the package, as it allows very flexible layouts. Additionally, the package needed to be able to handle survey (and frequency) data <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="&hellip; at the time of writing, which was September 2015.">(which it does, mostly, but still needs work)</span>.
  - As well as the graphics, I have built upon and expanded the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="graphical user interface">GUI</span> to make it responsive, cleaner, and hopefuly user-friendly. I touched up the <code>iNZightRegression</code> package to provide nicer ([survey] generalised) linear model summaries, as well as set up the R package repository for all of our packages to allow cleaner updating for users.
