info:
  - As part of my MSc Thesis work, I developed an R package to provide a simple method of fitting some fairly complicated Bayesian selectivity models. The package started off in a simple attempt to make my life easier, but in doing so I realised it might be useful to others. Where possible, I have used familiar syntax as to make it easy to use for non-specialists.
  - The package allows the fitting of simple through to fairly complex Bayesian selectivity models, including a simple, single variable logistic fit, automatic inclusion of sampling fractions, through to hierarchical multi-covariate models. Plot and summary methods have been included, which allow the resulting fit to easily be examined both visually and textually. The plots include fitted curves through the data, and posterior trace and density plots; the summaries provide estimates, variability, a formula for the model, fit assessment statistics, and Bayesian PPCs.
  - I have not yet submitted the package to CRAN, as I don't feel it is ready yet, but thanks to others' wonderful work, you can install directly from GitHub using <code>devtools</code>. More details can be found <a href="assets/docs/tomelliott-masters.pdf">in my thesis</a>.
