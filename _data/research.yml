    - Public transport prediction has received a lot of attention in the past, with several modelling techniques having been developed. However, many of these only account for information regarding a single bus or route. Further, anomalies caused by inadequate predictions (e.g., buses going "backwards in time" due to sudden increases in ETA) are encountered which understandably frustrate commuters.
    - A potential cause of these problems is that only data corresponding directly to the bus or route being predicted is used. We would like to implement Bayesian models that use all of the data - both live and historical - simultaneously to predict all bus arrival times, with the goal to improve prediction accuracy (e.g., if a bus is late due to heavy traffic, the next one along the same road probably will be too - even if it's a different route altogether). Inevitably, this introduces computational problems that will need to be overcome - an ideal system will be capable of making new predictions every minute or so.
    - The choice of summary statistic is also something we will investigate, especially the use of interval rather than point estimates. This could help to reduce anomalies such as "time-travelling buses", and give commuters a better idea of expected waiting times. From these new ideas we can investigate applications (e.g., journey planning) and accessibility options so commuters can readily access the information. We will be working with Auckland Transport, who have already agreed to give us access to the necessary data.

  text: The size-selectivity of fishing gear is of particular interest to fisheries managers, aiding in the reduction of by-catch and increase of profits. Size-selectivity models have typically been fitted using <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Generalised Linear Models">GLMs</span> and mixed-effects models implemented using software such as SAS. We investigate a Bayesian approach to fitting these models, with special focus on the comparability of frequentist and Bayesian models. We look at several case studies, which are used to establish the validity of our models by comparing our results to those published in previous analyses. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Mackov chain Monte Carlo">MCMC</span> diagnostic tests and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Posterior Predictive Checks">PPCs</span> for overdispersion are explored, and random-effects are shown to be the preferred method of modelling overdispersion in the data. Having formulated a general model, several extensions are investigated. The Poisson distribution is used as an alternative likelihood function, allowing the models to make use of any population size distribution information, and multiple random-effects models are implemented that were previously found to be too complex. Semiparametric selection curves&mdash;notably basis splines&mdash;are used with the constraint that they be continuous, non-decreasing functions of length. A new R package, <code>BSM</code>, is introduced as a simple tool for fitting many of the Bayesian selectivity models discussed in this thesis.

  text: Reverberation mapping is a technique used to infer the lag, <span class='math'>&tau;</span>, between two light curves obtained from two different regions of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Active Galactic Nuclei">AGN</span>. The lag can later be used in the estimation of the mass of the central black hole. Traditional reverberation mapping methods involve the use of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Cross Correlation Function">CCF</span>, and more recently Bayesian models to estimate the lag, however these require long, expensive observational campaigns to obtain the data necessary to infer the lag accurately. The difficulty in obtaining the data has led to the development of a new technique where the CCFs from multiple poorly-measured AGN are combined, or stacked, to infer a typical lag for the sample. Through simulation, this method was shown to recover the lag, although the population lag variability and uncertainty of the lag estimate due to the sparse data were difficult to differentiate from the stacked CCF. Therefore, we proposed using a Bayesian hierarchical model as an alternative, with the advantage of obtaining individual estimates for population variability and estimation error. After first implementing a simple model to show our method could be used to recover the population mean lag, we constructed a model that would analyse multiple AGN and infer the population distribution of lags.  We were able to recover the population parameters, and their associated uncertainties, and show that the population variability was separable from the uncertainty in estimating the mean lag.
