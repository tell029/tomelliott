    p My name is Tom, but you can call me &ldquo;Tom&rdquo;! I am a PhD Student at The University of Auckland, but you already knew that (because it says so above &hellip;). I have been studying at UoA since 2010 (that's like, #[a(href="#" data-reveal-id="questionMySanity")#[code expr $(date +%Y) - 2010]] years ago!!), although I did my undergraduate BSc in Biological Sciences &mdash; for what reason, I'm not too sure. Fortunately, I discovered statistics was far more interesting, converted to a double major, and have now done an Honours and Masters degree in Statistics.

    #questionMySanity.reveal-modal(data-reveal aria-labelledby="questionMySanity" aria-hidden="true" role="dialog")
      p For those of you who have no idea what that means &hellip;

      p &hellip; which means I started at UoA #[span.yearsSinceStarting] years ago.

      a(class="close-reveal-modal" aria-label="Close") &#215


    p I have also been (quite heavily) involved in the iNZightVIT project since the middle of 2012. At first, I implemented functionality for #[span(data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="Generalised Linear Models") GLMs] and Survey GLMS's in the model fitting module, but since then I have completely rewritten (twice) the plotting package #[code iNZightPlots], and made a significant contribution to just about everything else contained within iNZightVIT (for which I apologise).
