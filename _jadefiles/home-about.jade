      p Whilst completing my postgraduate studies, I also found a sort of "niche" for R programming, and managed to land myself a job working for Professor Chris Wild developing the iNZight software. iNZight is an easy-to-use data exploration and analysis tool, aimed primarily at high school students, but also <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="We have heard from users in Spain, Italy, USA, and have even had emails from election campaign managers in England!">used worldwide</span>. Over the past year or so, I have been extensively involved in many parts of iNZight, though the graphics module is my main contribution.
      
      p Outside of my university life, I enjoy reading, watching TV shows, playing computer games (badly), and haphazardly producing melodies on my piano.
